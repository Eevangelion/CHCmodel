# CHCmodel
Validator for Horn solver Spacer

Here are some of the utilities (works mostly on LIA-LIN tracks):
1. `chcmodel` -- check wether a given M is a model for CHC C (C and M in the same file)
2. `merge` -- merge benchmark and model to one file 
3. `convert` -- convert StarExec job output to models
